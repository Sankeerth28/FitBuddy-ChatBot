[Q] What are the requirements for building muscles?
[A] Building muscle requires a person to commit to regular strength training for a long period of time, with no shortcuts unfortunately. However, you can make this process more efficient with the right nutrition and workouts. While most people want to build muscle for aesthetic reasons, there are so many health benefits too, including: 
1) Increasing lean muscle mass, which means you will burn more calories at rest 
2) Addressing strength imbalances which can improve postural issues 
3) Improve overall strength, coordination, and balance
4) Improve bone density and slow down bone loss


What is Muscular Hypertrophy and what are its requirements?
[A] Gaining muscle, known as muscular hypertrophy, requires some serious strength training. Strength training causes microscopic tears in the muscle fibres, which sounds scary but is actually a prerequisite of growth. As the body repairs these tissues, they get bigger, and when this is repeated again and again this results in visibly bigger muscles. While all strength training will help to increase strength, there are certain ways to train that will maximise muscular hypertrophy. Read on to learn how to shape a strengthening workout plan that will help you to gain muscle, as well as some of the different approaches you could take. You can also click here to jump straight to the example workout plan for gaining muscle.


[Q] How often and how much should you work out to gain muscle?
[A] There are a few factors to consider when designing a workout plan aimed at building muscle: frequency, volume, weight, and progressive overload: 
1) Frequency of workouts: Most scientific studies on the matter conclude that a muscle needs to be worked at least two or three times a week in order to see it change and grow. This means you should aim to gym at least two times a week, up to a maximum of six times. It may be tempting to gym every day, but rest days are actually crucial when it comes to build muscle. 

2) Volume: The ideal workout volume (the number of reps and sets you do) changes depending on whether your goal is strength, endurance, or hypertrophy. For muscular hypertrophy, 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps per exercise is considered the best approach.  

3) Weight: Your workouts need to challenge the muscles enough to create change, which means choosing weights that are heavy enough that the last couple of repetitions are challenging but not impossible, but you would be unable to complete another rep with good form (or at all). 

4) Progressive overload: Progressive overload is one of the most important principles of strength training. Our bodies are great at adapting to stimulus, so if we repeatedly do the same number of reps and sets with the same weight, we will plateau. Progressive overload involves increasing the difficulty of an exercise over time, either by increasing the weight, reps, depth, or intensity (by slowing down the tempo, for example). 

For hypertrophy, what this might look like is doing 10kg for 3 sets of 8 reps one week, 10 reps, the week after, and 12 reps the week after, and then increasing to a weight you can only manage for 8 reps and repeating the process.

 
[Q] Are free weights or machines better for gaining muscle?
[A] Free weights and resistance machines are both great tools for building muscle, and while neither one is better nor worse, there are differences which can make one more suitable than the other. Resistance machines follow a fixed movement path which make them ideal for those who have just started a muscle-building program or are new to the gym. The fixed path makes it easier to perform an exercise as it does not rely on technical knowledge of the form, and this helps to ensure the right muscles are engaged while minimising risk of injury. 

It can also allow heavier weights to be lifted more safely, as there is no risk of dropping the weight. While good for beginners, these machines are also good for advanced lifters who want to really isolate a muscle and perfect their form. Free weights like dumbbells and barbells require the performer to have good form, and usually a strong core. Exercises with free weights are more challenging as more muscles need to be engaged to stabilise the movement. This extra challenge can fatigue the muscles quicker and help to build more strength and stability. If you are new to working out, or are struggling to engage the right muscles during exercises with free weights, resistance machines can be a great way to build strength and learn the correct form.   

Once you are comfortable with the exercise, you can move to free weights and use dumbbells or barbells to replicate the movement. For example, once you have mastered the Seated Chest Press, you can easily perform Lying Dumbbell Presses. If you are more experienced, you may prefer to use free weights or a mix of both. If you are struggling with form, certain pieces of equipment, like a weight training belt, might help.

 
[Q] Should I do "Split Workouts"?
[A] Split workouts involve splitting up the muscles worked across the week, so each workout focuses on one area of the body or one type of exercise, for example doing an upper body day one day, leg day the next, or doing push exercises one day, pull exercises another. 

Split workouts are useful when you are training on consecutive days, as you can give the muscles you used yesterday a rest while you work on a different area. Because each muscle group needs to be worked at least twice per week for muscle growth, split workouts work best when you are training at least 3-4 times a week. If you can only commit 2-3 times a week, full body workouts are best. 

Classic muscle building splits are: 
1) Push/Pull/Legs (6-day split)
2) Chest & Back/Legs/Shoulders & Arms (3-1-3 split)
3) Back & Biceps/Chest & Triceps/Legs/Shoulders (4-day split)
4) Chest/Back/Legs/Shoulders & Arms (also a 4-day split)
Rather than focus on body types, a push/pull/leg split (also known as PEOPLE) splits workouts by movement types. 

Pushing movements typically work chest, shoulders and triceps, while pulling movements work the back, glutes, and hamstrings.

 
[Q] Make a daily schedule of workout for building muscles.
[A] Gym Workout Routine to Build Muscle. Three top tips before you get started on your bulking workout plan:
In general, it is best to prioritise compound movements and supplement with isolation exercises. This means starting with exercises that work more than one muscle group (like a deadlift) and then finishing up with isolation exercises that focus on more specific muscles (such as bicep curls). 

Always begin with a dynamic warm-up and finish with some static stretches to cool down. This step is vital to maintain mobility and reduce your risk of injury. Make sure to include regular rest days. You will want to wait at least a day between working the same muscle group twice to give your muscles time to repair and grow between sessions, but schedule at least one full rest day a week. 

Here, I have pulled together an example gym plan for muscle gain, using the popular push/pull/legs split and aiming for six workouts a week. 

Remember, this is just an example - you can try different exercises and splits to find your own best workout plan for muscle gain. 

Day 1: 
Push Workout Barbell Bench Press (3 sets of 8-12 reps): A compound chest exercise targeting the pectoral muscles, triceps, and shoulders. Lie flat on a bench, grip the barbell, lower it to your chest, and press upwards until arms are fully extended.

Glute Kickbacks (3 sets of 8-12 reps): Isolates the glutes. Using a cable machine or bodyweight, kick one leg back while keeping your core tight and controlling the movement back down. 

Day 7: Rest

 
[Q] Suggest some muscle building exercises for beginners.
[A] Here are some muscle building exercises, especially for beginners. 

1. Push-ups for Upper-body Strength: Push-ups are considerably effective muscle-building exercise that targets the shoulders, chest, triceps, and core. As per fitness professionals at Anytime Fitness, a beginner should start with wall push-ups or knee push-ups. You should try to keep your core engaged and your body should be in a straight-line form, from head to heels. 

2. Pull-ups: Effective for Arm and Back Muscles: One of the most effective bodyweight exercises is Pull-ups. It works exceptionally well for beginners to target their upper back, shoulders, and biceps. It can be quite challenging for beginners, so fitness experts suggest using assisted variations or resistance bands. 

3. Lunges for Leg and Glute Muscles: Lunges are fundamentally good for leg muscle and strength. This is a type of muscle building exercise that targets the quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and calves. Talking about it, lunges engage the core for stability, making them a perfect choice for beginners working on leg strength. Variations like walking lunges or reverse lunges can be included to target various muscle groups and enhance balance and stability. 

4. Overhead Press for Shoulder Development: The overhead press, a muscle building exercise, is a compound exercise that specifically targets the deltoids, triceps, and upper chest. Variations, like the seated overhead press or Arnold press, can be included to target diverse areas of the shoulders and add variety to your routine. For beginners, it is advised to begin with lightweight dumbbells, or a barbell, to comprehensively focus on proper form. 

5. Barbell Curls for Biceps Strength: One of the classic exercises for muscle strength is Barbell curls. This muscle building exercise concentrates on the muscles of the upper arm and is exceptional for beginners who want to enhance their arm toughness and definition. Let us tell you that a good starting weight for beginners might be approximately 20-30 lbs. The most appropriate technique that a beginner can get is via personal training. The personal trainers bring a wealth of expertise, provide guidance for proper form and posture, educate about weight training, and more. You can explore the reasons why you need a personal trainer.

 
[Q] How to increase intensity of workouts to build muscles?
[A] To increase the intensity of your workouts instead of working out for long periods, get plenty of sleep and give your muscles time for recovery. For getting adequate guidance for muscle building, a beginner should consider a gym membership that offers proper access to professional trainers and a variety of equipment, and it precisely sets the stage for achieving your long-term fitness aspirations. In addition, a beginner must know what they need to sign up for a gym membership. Always remember, a little progress each day adds up to big results.

 
[Q] I want to develop stronger and leaner muscles
[A] To develop stronger and leaner muscles, focus on strength training exercises like squats, deadlifts, and bench presses, while maintaining a calorie-controlled diet to reduce body fat.

 
[Q] I want to concentrate on fitness and strength levels. How can I do that?
[A] Improving your fitness and strength levels requires a combination of cardiovascular workouts and progressive resistance training with heavier weights to build muscle and enhance endurance.

 
[Q] I want to improve endurance and muscle size.
[A] To improve endurance and muscle size, perform higher-rep sets (12-15 reps) with moderate weights and combine them with compound movements like squats and deadlifts.

 
[Q] I want to increase my bicep and tricep strength.
[A] To increase bicep and tricep strength, focus on isolation exercises like barbell curls and tricep extensions, while progressively increasing the weight or reps for maximum growth.

 
[Q] I want to enhance my upper body muscles.
[A] Enhancing your upper body muscles requires compound exercises like bench presses, military presses, and pull-ups, along with isolation exercises like bicep curls and tricep extensions.


 
[Q] How important is nutrition for gaining muscle?
[A] It is possible to build muscle without paying attention to nutrition, but it is much more efficient to do so when you are properly fuelling muscle growth with your diet. If you are happy with your body fat and want to focus on building muscle, aim to eat in a slight calorie surplus (around 5-10% above your maintenance calories) and aim to get at least 1.4 grams of protein per kg of bodyweight, ideally through nutritious protein sources like lean meats, eggs, legumes, and dairy. If you have a lot of excess fat stored and are trying to lose weight, you will be pleased to know it is still possible to build muscle while in a calorie deficit. Protein is even more important when it comes to preserving and building muscle when dieting, as it helps to prevent your body from burning muscle instead of fat. While food is helpful in recovering from workouts and building muscle, they also play a part in fuelling your workouts. Eating carbohydrates before your workout can boost your energy and ensure you can really deliver your best each workout. Many diets offer benefits that go beyond weight loss. The best programs for losing weight also improve your overall health. The biggest challenge is finding the one that will work for you. Diets are not just for weight loss. While changing your diet can be one of the best ways to lose weight, it can also be a gateway to improving your habits, focusing on your health, and leading a more active lifestyle.

[Q] Give complete description about The Mediterranean diet.
[A] The Mediterranean diet has long been considered the gold standard for nutrition, disease prevention, wellness, and longevity. This is based on its nutrition benefits and sustainability.
The Mediterranean diet is based on foods that people in countries like Italy and Greece have traditionally eaten. It is rich in:
vegetables
fruits
whole grains
fish
nuts
lentils
olive oil
Foods such as poultry, eggs, and dairy products are to be eaten in moderation, and red meats are limited.
Additionally, the Mediterranean diet limits:

refined grains
trans fats
processed meats
added sugar
other highly processed foods
Health benefits
This diet’s emphasis on minimally processed foods and plants has been associated with a reduced risk of multiple chronic diseases and increased life expectancy. Studies also show that the Mediterranean diet has a preventive effect against certain cancers (1Trusted Source).

Though the diet was designed to lower heart disease risk, numerous studies indicate that its plant-based, high unsaturated fat dietary pattern can also aid in weight loss. Eating less meat is also associated with a more sustainable diet for the planet.

Downsides
Since the Mediterranean diet does not put a big emphasis on dairy products, it is important to make sure you still get enough calcium and vitamin D in your diet.

[Q] Give description about DASH diet.
[A] DASH diet
Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, or DASH, is an eating plan designed to help treat or prevent high blood pressure, which is clinically known as hypertension.

It emphasizes eating plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean meats. It is low in salt, red meat, added sugars, and fat.

While the DASH diet is not a weight loss diet, many people report losing weight on it.

The DASH diet recommends specific servings of different food groups. The number of servings you are encouraged to eat depends on your daily calorie intake.

For example, each day an average person on the DASH diet would eat about:

five servings of vegetables
five servings of fruit
seven servings of healthy carbs like whole grains
two servings of low fat dairy products
two servings or fewer of lean meats
In addition, it is recommended to consume nuts and seeds two to three times per week (7Trusted Source).

Health benefits
The DASH diet has been shown to reduce blood pressure levels and several heart disease risk factors. Also, it may help lower your risk of breast and colorectal cancers.
Downsides
While the DASH diet may aid with weight loss and lower blood pressure in individuals with hypertension, there is mixed evidence on salt intake and blood pressure. Eating too little salt has been linked to increased insulin resistance, and a low sodium diet is not the right choice for everyone. A low sodium diet like the DASH diet is more appropriate for individuals with hypertension or other health conditions that benefit from or require sodium restriction.
 
[Q] Tell me about Plant-based and flexitarian diets.
[A] Plant-based and flexitarian diets
Vegetarianism and veganism are the most popular versions of plant-based diets, which restrict animal products for health, ethical, and environmental reasons.

However, more flexible plant-based diets also exist, such as the flexitarian diet. This is a plant-based diet that allows eating animal products in moderation.

Typical vegetarian diets restrict meat of all kinds but allow dairy products. Typical vegan diets restrict all animal products, including dairy, butter, and sometimes other byproducts like honey.

The flexitarian eating plan does not have clear-cut rules or recommendations about calories and macronutrients, so it is considered more of a lifestyle than a diet. Its principles include:

consuming protein from plants instead of animals
eating mostly fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains
eating the least processed, most natural forms of foods
limiting sugar and sweets
Additionally, it allows the flexibility to consume meat and animal products from time to time.

Health benefits
Numerous studies have shown that plant-based diets can reduce your risk of developing chronic diseases, including improved markers of metabolic health, decreased blood pressure, and reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. They can also help you lose weight.

Flexitarian diets have also been shown to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes and improve metabolic health and blood pressure, plus may have their own weight loss benefits.
Downsides
Plant-based eating patterns like vegetarianism and veganism can sometimes be difficult to maintain and may feel restricting, especially if you are switching from a more meat-based eating style.
 
[Q] I want you to recommend a meal plan based on MIND diet
[A] The MIND diet
The Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet combines aspects of the Mediterranean and DASH diets to create an eating pattern that focuses on brain health. Like the flexitarian diet, the MIND diet does not have a strict meal plan, but instead encourages eating 10 specific foods with brain health benefits.

Per week, MIND includes eating:

six or more servings of green, leafy vegetables
one serving of non-starchy vegetables
five or more servings of nuts
Other foods it encourages multiple times a week include:

berries
beans
olive oil
whole grains
fish
poultry
Health benefits
Research shows that the MIND diet may reduce a person’s risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease, and studies show that the MIND diet is superior to other plant-rich diets for improving cognition (20Trusted Source, 21Trusted Source).

Research also shows that the MIND diet can help slow cognitive decline and improve resiliency in older adults (22Trusted Source).

It may also help delay the onset of the movement disorder Parkinson’s disease (23Trusted Source).

There is little research concerning the MIND diet and weight loss. Yet, since it is a combination of two diets that promote weight loss, the MIND diet may also help you lose weight.

One way it can help promote weight loss is that it encourages limiting your consumption of foods like:

butter
cheese
red meat
fried food
sweets
However, more research needs to be done concerning the MIND diet and weight loss.
 
[Q] What do understand by WW in diet plans?
[A] WW (formerly Weight Watchers)
WW, formerly Weight Watchers, is one of the most popular weight loss programs worldwide.

While it does not restrict any food groups, people on a WW plan must eat within their set number of daily points to help them reach their ideal weight.

WW is a points-based system that assigns different foods and beverages a value, depending on their calorie, fat, and fiber contents.

As you work to reach your desired weight, you must stay within your daily point allowance.

Health benefits
Many studies show that the WW program can help you lose weight.
What is more, people who follow WW programs have been shown to be more successful at maintaining weight loss after several years, compared with those who follow other diets.
WW allows flexibility, which makes it easy to follow. This enables people with dietary restrictions, such as those with food allergies, to adhere to the plan.

Downsides
While it allows for flexibility, WW can be costly depending on the subscription plan and the length of time you intend to follow it.

Studies show that it may take up to 52 weeks to produce significant weight loss and clinical benefits (27Trusted Source).

Additionally, its flexibility can be a downfall if dieters choose unhealthy foods.
 
[Q] What is Intermittent fasting?
[A] Intermittent fasting
Intermittent fasting is a dietary strategy that cycles between periods of fasting and eating.

Various forms exist, including the 16/8 method, which involves limiting your calorie intake to 8 hours per day. There is also the 5:2 method, which restricts your daily calorie intake to 500–600 calories twice per week.

While it is primarily known as a diet for weight loss, intermittent fasting may have powerful benefits for both your body and brain.

How it works
Intermittent fasting restricts the time you are allowed to eat, which is a simple way to reduce your calorie intake. This can lead to weight loss — unless you compensate by eating too much food during allowed eating periods.

Health benefits
Intermittent fasting has been linked to anti-aging effects, increased insulin sensitivity, improved brain health, reduced inflammation, and many other benefits.

Both animal and human studies show that intermittent fasting may also increase heart health and extend lifespan.

It can also help you lose weight.

Downsides
In general, intermittent fasting is safe for most healthy adults.

That said, those sensitive to drops in their blood sugar levels should talk with a health professional before starting intermittent fasting. These groups include people:

who have diabetes
who have low weight
who have an eating disorder
who are pregnant
who are breastfeeding or chestfeeding

[Q] What do you know about Volumetrics diet?
[A] The Volumetrics diet
The Volumetrics diet was created by Penn State University nutrition professor Barbara Rolls and is meant to be a long-term lifestyle change rather than a strict diet.

The eating plan is designed to promote weight loss by having you fill up on nutrient-dense foods that are low in calories and high in water.

Meanwhile, it limits calorie-dense foods like cookies, candies, nuts, seeds, and oils.

The Volumetrics diet divides food into four categories based on food’s calorie density, which can be calculated with a formula created by Rolls. These categories are:

Category one: includes foods of very low calorie density, like non-starchy fruits and vegetables, nonfat milk, and broth-based soup
Category two: includes low calorie-dense foods, like starchy fruits and vegetables, grains, breakfast cereal, low fat meat, legumes, and low fat mixed dishes like chili
Category three: includes medium calorie-dense foods, like meat, cheese, pizza, bread, and ice cream
Category four: includes high calorie-dense foods, like crackers, chips, chocolate candies, nuts, butter, and oil
Meals on the Volumetric diet consist mostly of foods from categories one and two, with limited amounts of food from categories three and four.

No foods are completely off-limits on the Volumetrics diet, and exercise is encouraged for at least 30–60 minutes each day.

Health benefits
The Volumetrics diet encourages nutritious foods that are low in calories but high in fiber, vitamins, and minerals, which may help increase your intake of key nutrients and protect against nutritional deficiencies.
The Volumetrics diet may also help you lose weight.

Downsides
While the Volumetrics diet may be effective for health benefits and weight loss, it requires a good understanding of Volumetrics, which involves learning about the calorie levels of foods in relation to portion sizes and nutrient levels.
 
[Q] What is Mayo Clinic Diet?
[A] The Mayo Clinic Diet
The Mayo Clinic Diet was created by the reputable medical organization of the same name.

Designed to be a lifestyle change over a quick fix, the Mayo Clinic Diet focuses on replacing less healthy behaviors with ones that are more likely to support longevity and weight loss.

Rather than banning certain foods, the Mayo Clinic Diet uses a pyramid to encourage exercise and illustrate quantities of foods you should be consuming.

Fruits, vegetables, and physical activity make up the base of the pyramid, followed by carbs in the next layer, then protein and dairy, fats, and finally, sweets.

The diet consists of two phases. An initial, 2-week phase designed to kick-start your weight loss by introducing 5 healthier habits and encouraging you to break 5 common less healthy habits.

The second phase is more of a lifestyle change designed to be followed long-term, encouraging education about nutritious food choices and portion sizes in addition to being physically active.

Health benefits
Little research is available about the health benefits of the Mayo Clinic Diet.

However, the Mayo Clinic tells users to expect about 10 pounds of weight loss during the first 2 weeks, and up to 2 pounds during the second phase.

Since diets rich in fiber can increase satiety by making you feel more full, the Mayo Clinic Diet may contribute to weight loss. It may also decrease your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Additionally, studies show that exercising while on a lower-calorie diet is more effective at promoting weight loss than dieting alone.

Downsides
While the digital version of the program includes meal plans, recipes, a food tracker, virtual group sessions, at-home workouts, and more, it will cost you monthly to buy into the program.

[Q] Give description about Low carb diets.
[A] Low carb diets
Low carb diets are among the most popular diets for weight loss. Examples include the Atkins diet, ketogenic (keto) diet, and low carb, high fat (LCHF) diet.

Some varieties reduce carbs more drastically than others. For instance, very low carb diets like the keto diet restrict this macronutrient to under 10% of total calories, compared with 30% or less for other types (44Trusted Source).

How it works
Low carb diets restrict your carb intake in favor of protein and fat.

They are typically higher in protein than low fat diets, which is important, as protein can help curb your appetite, raise your metabolism, and conserves muscle mass.

In very low carb diets like keto, your body begins using fatty acids rather than carbs for energy by converting them into ketones. This process is called ketosis.

Health benefits
Research suggests that low carb diets may reduce risk factors for heart disease, including high cholesterol and blood pressure levels. They may also improve blood sugar and insulin levels in people with type 2 diabetes.

Many studies indicate that low carb diets can aid weight loss and may be more effective than conventional low fat diets.
Downsides
In some cases, a low carb diet may raise LDL (bad) cholesterol levels. Very low carb diets can also be difficult to follow and because digestive upset in some people.
In very rare situations, following a very low carb diet may cause a condition known as ketoacidosis, a dangerous metabolic condition that can be fatal if left untreated.
 
[Q] What is Keto Diet?
[A] The ketogenic diet involves consuming a very low amount of carbohydrates and replacing them with fat to help your body burn fat for energy. Health benefits can include weight loss and lowering your risk for certain diseases.

The ketogenic diet (or keto diet, for short) is a low carb, high fat diet that offers many health benefits.

In fact, many studies show that this type of diet can help you lose weight and improve your health. Ketogenic diets may even have benefits against diabetes, cancer, epilepsy, and Alzheimer’s disease

Here is a detailed guide to the keto diet:
The ketogenic diet is a very low carb, high fat diet that shares many similarities with the Atkins and low carb diets.

It involves drastically reducing carbohydrate intake and replacing it with fat. This reduction in carbs puts your body into a metabolic state called ketosis.

When this happens, your body becomes incredibly efficient at burning fat for energy. It also turns fat into ketones in the liver, which can supply energy for the brain.

Ketogenic diets can cause significant reductions in blood sugar and insulin levels. This, along with the increased ketones, has some health benefits
 
[Q] What is the very best diet plan?
[A] There is not one diet that can be said to be the best. Many diets can help you lose weight and offer unique health benefits.
Some of the most popular eating plans include the Mediterranean diet, WW (Weight Watchers), the MIND diet, the DASH diet, intermittent fasting, plant-based diets, low-carb diets, the Mayo Clinic Diet, and the Volumetrics diet.

 
[Q] Is dieting only associated with weigh loss?
[A] Dieting is not just about weight loss. Many diets provide additional health benefits. To get the best outcome, you need to find the program that works for your particular needs. The biggest difficulty is discovering which one that will be.

Before starting any kind of new diet, it is always a good idea to talk with your doctor about your personal health history. They can help you decide which plan would work best for you.

Once you have decided to start a new diet, a registered dietitian can help you navigate the new rules and help you plan meals that you actually want to eat.

[Q] Give some recommendations on how to move body before meditation
[A] A Simple Practice to Move Your Body Before You Meditate
1) Hand Walking Meditation 
Place your right hand on the floor. Then, place your left hand on the floor. Walk the right hand a little bit forward. Then repeat this movement with the left hand.

2) Find Balance on All Fours
Take your time and notice how your weight shifts onto your hands as you move forward. Move around: Shift weight to the right hand and right knee, then to the left, forward and back. Slowly settle into equal weight on all fours.

3) Cat Pose
On your next inhale, lift up your seat and your chest, while you simultaneously drop your spine toward the earth and into your belly.

4) Cow Pose
Exhale, reversing this curve. Lift your waist; drop your head and tail. Repeat 3 & 4, moving with the breath, 5-10 times. Go slowly and try to feel every part of your spine as it curves one way and rounds the other way.

5) Stand Up
Step back your right hand, step back your left hand, and then shift onto your feet and stand up. As always, as your attention strays come back to attending to the physical sensations.

6) Shoulder Rotations 
Extend your arms out to the side. Inhale and roll your arms so your palms face up. Exhale and roll arms in, palms back. Begin this action from the shoulders, letting your pinky fingers be the last part to roll up and down.

7) Side Bends
Inhale, move your arms up. Exhale, bend to the right. Inhale, move your arms up. Exhale, bend to the left. Pay attention to the movements from side to side, as well as the position of your head.

8) Chair Pose
Inhale, arms up and bend your knees into a chair pose—two movements at the same time! 
Is your mind still in your body? In the room? Gently let it come back.

9) Leg Bends
As you exhale, stand up on your left leg, right leg bent. Return to chair pose and repeat on the other side. Go right and left, 5-10 times.

10) Stand Quietly
Remain still, keeping your eyes open. Notice what you are seeing. Ground yourself in your environment. Feel your feet on the floor. Observe your breath moving. You can repeat this entire sequence. Feel free to do it as often as you like.

 
[Q] Can you recommend some yoga poses for a Good Night's Sleep?
[A] Sure! Here are four best Yoga Stretches for a Good Night’s Sleep:
1. Bridge
Lie on your back and bend your knees with your feet close together but not touching. With your arms along your sides and palm facing up, press your feet into the floor, reach your tailbone to your knees, and lift your hips into the air, tucking in your pelvis and using a block or cushion for support underneath your lower back if preferred. This position opens up your hips and quads and allows you to observe your belly as you breathe.

2. Supported Fish
Lie on your back with a pillow supporting your shoulder blades. Position your arms out at 45 degrees from your hips with your palms up. You can keep your legs straight or have your knees bent and together with your feet slightly apart. This will help relax your upper-back muscles and stretch your chest.

3. Spinal Twist
Lie on your back with arms out in a T formation and palms up. Start with straight legs, then bend your right knee and bring right foot onto your your left leg wherever it feels comfortable. Gently press your right knee to the left with your left hand, twisting your torso. You may feel a stretch in your shoulder, chest, lower back, hip, or thigh—it will be where you most need it. Return to the centre and do the other side.

4. Legs Up the Wall
Lie on your back with bent knees and move your buttocks as close to the wall as possible. Bring your legs up the wall, lift up your hips, and put a pillow under your lower back to keep your pelvis off the floor. Keep your feet apart a few inches and relaxed. After a day spent standing or sitting, your legs will feel lighter and your body will feel more balanced overall.

 
[Q] Suggest some meditative exercises for good sleep.
[A] A Guided Meditation for Better Sleep
In considering any meditation related to sleep, recognize that there is nothing to force, and nothing to make happen. Since striving makes sleep more challenging, set out to practice without specific expectations or goals. We cannot make ourselves sleep, but perhaps, by aiming to stay settled and getting less caught up in our thoughts, we fall asleep anyway.

For the meditation that follows, there will be no ending bell or instruction. At the end, continue to practice if you like, or hopefully enjoy a good night’s rest instead.

1. Start while lying down, allowing your legs to rest in a comfortable posture, hip-width apart. You can place your arms by your side or your hands on your belly.
2. Begin by noticing your breath. Pay attention, as best as you are able to the physical movement related to breathing, such as your belly rising and falling. Or, if you prefer, focus your attention more closely on the air moving in and out of your nose and mouth.
3. It is normal, expected even, to have thoughts—lots of them.  Your mind rehashes the day or gets caught up in worrying about tomorrow. Recognize those habits, and then practice letting them be. Label whatever grabs your attention, and come back again to noticing the breath. Breathing in… and breathing out.
4. Notice if you get caught up in effort, or frustration, or fear, with compassion for yourself. Catch thoughts of self-criticism or frustration, and come back to just one breath, one more time. Thoughts are only thoughts. Breathing in… breathing out. There is nothing you need to fix or change right now in this moment. Notice where your thoughts go, and label them “thoughts.” Come back to one next breath, over, and over again.
5. Shift attention to sensations in your body. Start by moving your awareness to physical sensations in your feet. You do not need to wiggle your toes or move your feet, just notice them—the temperature or the pressure of your heel against the blanket or the mat beneath you.
6. From your feet, move your attention into your lower legs, noticing whatever there is to see. Letting go of a sense of effort or needing to make anything happen. And then from your lower legs, through your knees, and into your upper legs. If you feel any sense of stress or tension, aim to relax and let go.
7. Then move your attention through your buttocks and pelvis, and into your belly and abdomen. You might notice a sense of your breath moving up and down, or other physical sensations, or sometimes even reflection of emotion (perhaps an emotion like fear or anger reflects in the stomach in the form of tension or tightness). And as you move from your belly and now into your chest, note each time your mind gets caught up in thoughts of discomfort or distraction. And then gently and with patience, guiding it back one more time.
8. Move around into your back, certainly a place many of us hold tension in different ways, relaxing your muscles as best as you are able, lowering your shoulders from your ears. If you feel a need to make an adjustment, allow that to happen with intention, pausing and choosing your next action. Shift your attention into your hands and lower arms, again without actively needing to move or change anything, observing and letting go.
9. Then moving through your neck and into the muscles of your face, perhaps noticing any locations of tightness or pinching, and then with gentleness, as best as you are able, relaxing those muscles. And then for a few moments, have a general awareness of physical sensations throughout your body.
10. And now, if you are still awake, bring your attention back to the breath, each time the mind wanders into the past or into the future, or wherever it chooses to go. If it is a useful anchor for your attention, you can count breaths, breathing in, one, breathing out, one, breathing in, two, breathing out, two… When you reach ten, start at one again.
11. If counting becomes a distraction, then just stay with the sensation of breathing—wherever you feel the breath entering or leaving your body, or the rising or falling of your belly and chest. Continue on your own now, counting breaths up to ten, patiently returning your attention whenever you become distracted. If you lose track of counting, that is fine. Start over wherever you last remember.

 
[Q] What are Meditation Exercises and Activities which can be done on our own?
[A] There are many types of meditation practices and activities you can do on your own. There are also activities you can do as part of a group.

A meditation exercise can be as simple as doing some deep breathing, or as complex as repeating a mantra or doing Transcendental meditation. Any activity that helps to quiet the mind could be considered a meditative activity, even sitting outside and quietly watching the world go by.

There are many types of meditations, including but not limited to:

1. Deep breathing exercises
2. Relaxation exercises
3. Guided Imagery and Visualization
4. Focused Attention Meditation
5. Loving-kindness Meditation
6. Progressive Relaxation Meditation
7. Body Scan Meditation
8. Mindfulness Meditation
9. Awareness of the Breath Meditation
10.Transcendental Meditation
11.Zen Meditation
12.Yoga Meditation

 
[Q] Suggest some meditative breathing exercises
[A] Here are some Meditation Breathing Exercises:

1. The Stimulating Breath or Bellow Breath.
2. Relaxing Breathing Exercise (4-7-8 Breathing).
3. Counting the Breath.
Practicing regular mindful breathing can help you feel calm and energized, and it may even help you manage stress-related health problems.
Breathing is something we can regulate and control, and it is an excellent tool for helping to clear the mind and achieve a state of relaxation.
These simple breathing techniques can help you relax and help you reduce stress.

1. The stimulating breath (Bellows breath)
The stimulating breath or bellows breath is a great way to boost your energy. This type of breathing practice is often done in yoga to help increase Prana, or life force energy.

The stimulating breath can help you increase your energy and help you be more alert. The bellows breath is a safe practice, but it could make you dizzy initially until your body gets used to the increased energy.

Strive for no more than 15 seconds or so on your first try, working up to a minute. Each time you practice this breath, you can increase your time little by little.

Sit up tall with your back straight and relax your shoulders.
Begin inhaling and exhaling rapidly through your nose. Keep your mouth closed but relaxed. The in and out breaths should be equal in duration, but as short and quick as possible. The bellows breath is a noisy breathing exercise.
Try for three complete breath cycles per second. As you breathe, you will notice a quick movement of the diaphragm, like a bellows.
This technique should leave you feeling invigorated and alert.

2. Relaxing breathing (4-7-8) exercise
The 4-7-8 breathing exercise is a straightforward technique, as well. It involves breathing in while counting to four, holding the breath to the count of seven, and exhaling to the count of eight.
This technique is a natural tranquilizer for the nervous system. However, you should not do more than four breaths at one time initially because it may leave you feeling lightheaded.

Sit with a straight back and relax your shoulders.
Place your tongue tip against the tissue behind your upper front teeth and try and keep your tongue in place as you breathe.
Inhale through your nose to a count of four.
Hold your breath for seven seconds.
Exhale through your mouth for approximately eight seconds.
This is considered one cycle of breath. You may repeat this three or four more times.

The most important thing about this exercise is the 4-7-8 ratio. If you have trouble holding your breath for seven seconds, you can speed the practice up.

Once you learn this technique, you can use it to combat stress when you feel it coming on.

3. Counting the breath
Counting the breath is another good exercise.

Sit in a comfortable position with your back straight. Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths in and out breathe naturally.
Now, as you inhale, mentally count to one and slowly exhale.
Inhale again, counting to two, and slowly exhale.
Repeat this cycle as long as you feel like doing it, counting as you go.
Strive for a ten-minute breathing practice.

 
[Q] Can you recommend some exercises for reducing stress and anxiety
[A] Three Exercises to Help with Anxiety and Stress

1. The Body Scan Meditation
The body scan meditation, or body awareness, is an exercise that allows you to tune out distractions while focusing on various areas of the body.

Body Scanning is a great technique that helps you become more aware of how you are feeling in any given moment.

Excess muscle tension exacerbates muscle pain, headaches, and fatigue, and scanning the body can help you prevent the build-up of pressure.

You can either do a quick body scan or a more extended scan. A quick scan can help you immediately release tension, and it only takes a few seconds.

Get into a comfortable position. You can sit or lie down.
Close your eyes for a deeper practice.
Starting with your feet and toes, tune into and pay attention to any sensations you feel, like pain or discomfort. You may also notice sensations like tingling, stinging, aching or throbbing.
Take a nice deep breath in through your nose, exhaling through the mouth, releasing the uncomfortable sensation. Allow that area of your body to release, loosen up, and soften.
Work your way up the body, paying attention to how you feel as you focus on the legs, the hips, the back, the stomach, the chest, the neck and shoulders, the arms and hands, and finally the face.
Move progressively up your body, focusing on each muscle group one at a time.

2. Diaphragmatic breathing
Diaphragmatic breathing or abdominal breathing is another good way to ease stress and anxiety. Breathing in this manner produces the relaxation response in the body, which allows the respiratory system to function correctly.

Breathing shallow can often contribute to feelings of anxiety, panic, or stress. Practicing abdominal breathing allows the mind and body to slow down and relax.

Lie on your back on a supportive surface. Bend your knees and support your head with a pillow. You may also place a pillow under your knees.
Place one hand on your chest and the other below your rib cage. Breathe in deeply through your nose so you can feel the hand on your stomach gently rising.
Allow the muscles of your stomach to tense and tighten as you exhale through your lips.
Practice this breathing technique for about 5-10 minutes 3-4 times a day if possible. This type of deep breathing is excellent for stress, and it helps calm and relaxes you.

3. Progressive muscle relaxation
Progressive muscle relaxation is a simple exercise where you tense and release all the muscles in your body, working your way up from the feet and toes to the head.

The exercise is designed to help the body progressively relax, just like the name sounds. This technique can help decrease muscle tension, fatigue, neck and back pain, or even muscle spasms.

This technique also reduces the physiological tension caused by thoughts that tend to provoke anxiety.

In this exercise, you should strive to tense and then relax all of those large muscles in the body. This should be done systematically either working your way down from the head or up from the feet and toes.

Deep muscle relaxation helps reduce physiological tension as well.

Get into a comfortable position, either sitting or lying down.
Strive to tense and then release each large muscle or muscle group for about five seconds or so, then relax the muscles.
Begin by taking a few deep breaths from the abdomen. Tense, hold, and relax each large muscle group, working your way up or down the body.
Try and notice the contrast between a tensed state and a relaxed state inhaling as you tense the muscle and exhaling as you relax and let go.
Once you have mastered this technique, you can then do a quick version in which whole muscle groups are tensed and relaxed simultaneously.

 
[Q] I want some meditative exercises for improving concentration.
[A] Meditation to Improve Concentration
Focused Meditation is a good way to improve your concentration and focus.

Focused meditation is a technique where you choose to focus on something like an object with solitary intent. You would focus on this object to the exclusion of all other things (Bertone, 2020).

For example, you can focus on a flower, a small stone, or anything you find lying around like a candle or a decorative object. You can also focus on the object with your eyes open, and then close your eyes and try and imagine the object in every little detail.

In this exercise, you would practice focusing with attention without trying too hard. By choosing to focus on one thing only, like a small object, you begin to quiet your busy mind and feel that sense of peace in the spaces between the thoughts.

The focused meditation technique is a very calming and centering practice because it anchors you in the present moment, freeing you from judgments about the past or worrying about the future.

Find an object to focus on. If you would like to hold an object to start with, you may do that now.
Begin by closing your eyes and focusing your attention on your breath, breathing slowly and deeply.
Now begin to focus on your object. If you are holding something, open your eyes for a brief moment and study the object, looking at all those little details. Gently close your eyes once again.
If you are picturing an object, start thinking about the item and focus your attention on what you recall about the object. If you are inside, you can also focus in on whatever is nearby like a lamp, a candle, or a small object.
Imagine this object in every little detail. If you are outside, focus on something in your immediate environment.
As you close your eyes, try and recall every little detail of this object in your mind’s eye, and see how powerful your perceptions are. Recall all of the tiny little details down to each crease and each small little bump. Focus all of your attention on this process and see what you recall.
The more you practice this type of focused meditation, the easier it will be to recall all of those little details, helping you sharpen your focus.

 
[Q] Enlist easy mediation exercises for beginners.
[A] Two Easy Meditation Exercises for Beginners
Everyone is a beginner at one point. If you are only starting meditating, do not feel that you have to catch up with everyone else. Instead, make use of the following beginner meditation exercises and set your own pace.

1. Walking meditation
Nothing is simpler than a walking meditation. A walking meditation is a great choice for those who like the outdoors or for those who have trouble sitting still and clearing their mind.

In walking meditation, you walk silently and contemplatively. Walking is very calming for the mind, body, and spirit (Hanh, 2011). If you find yourself stressed, one of the best things you can do is to get outside and move and take a break. Taking a short walk, or even a long walk is simple to do, and it can help ease away stress and anxiety.

For those who have trouble sitting still, a walking meditation is a wonderful option. Incorporating a simple walking meditation into your day is a wonderful way to ease away the tension of the day. The goal of walking meditation is to become mindful of the present moment. You can do a walking meditation anywhere, but an ideal place is a park or somewhere that has greenery or foliage.

This Walking Meditation is based on the guided walking meditation from Jon Kabat-Zinn, a mindfulness expert.

Start by finding a suitable location, a peaceful place where you will not be disturbed or observed.
Walk 10-15 steps and then pause and breathe for as long as you like.
Observe the environment around you. Stop and contemplate the trees, the foliage, the flowers, and even the ground you are standing on. Notice all the little details.
You can also observe as you walk. The idea behind the practice is to walk silently and with a sense of deep contemplation.
You can also focus on the sound of your footsteps as you walk and notice how your feet hit the ground.

A walking meditation involves very deliberate thinking and doing a series of actions that you usually do automatically.

As you walk, try to focus your attention on one or more sensations that you would typically take for granted, such as your breathing, the way your legs move or how the air feels against your skin.

If your mind wanders, continue focusing on something specific in your environment.

2. Gratitude meditation
A Gratitude Meditation is a practice where you reflect on all the gifts in your life. It is a simple practice with significant results.

This meditation offered by Dr. Kathi Kemper at the Ohio State University’s Center for Integrative Health and Wellness is a great place to start.

The practice of focusing on things you feel grateful for can help you shift your focus away from the negative and onto the positive.

As you experience positive emotions like gratitude, loving-kindness, and compassion, your awareness broadens, and your creativity and problem-solving capacities expand.

A short version of this meditation could be done by closing your eyes, taking a deep breath and mentally listing 5-7 things you feel grateful for like a warm home, a soft blanket, a loving spouse, a caring friend or even a good job or financial security.

 
[Q] Suggest some useful classroom activities for students related to meditation.
[A] Three Classroom Meditation Activities for Students
Below you will find a few mindfulness meditation activities that can be easily taught to students.

1. Stillness challenge
Using a timer and calming music is a great way to teach children the basic premise behind meditation and mindfulness.

Students are asked to sit still and listen to the soothing music without moving. You can also dim the lights and perhaps set a timer for 3-5 minutes.

Ask students to find a cozy spot and to sit comfortably and tell them that together you are going to start a new stillness challenge.

The object of the challenge is to sit with your eyes closed without moving or fidgeting as much as possible.

Once the timer goes off, they can then open their eyes and stretch. You can also start with 1 minute and work up to more extended time frames.

2. Breathing buddy meditation
The breathing buddy meditation involves holding a stuffed animal. Students begin by choosing a stuffed animal like a teddy bear and then lying down and closing their eyes.

Next, you set a timer for 3-5 minutes and ask the students to place the stuffed animal on their belly as they rest.

If the object falls off, they can put it back and keep breathing. The objective is to keep the focus on the breath and to balance the object for as long as they can do so.

3. Sound focus meditation
The sound focus meditation involves listening to some bell or tone, like a Tibetan singing bowl.

Students are asked to sit comfortably with their eyes closed. As students listen to the bell or the tone, they are asked to breathe quietly and listen intently, especially as the sound fades away.

This exercise is a good way to help students learn to focus and concentrate.

 
[Q] Give suggestion for some quick and fun meditation activities.
[A] Two Quick and Fun Meditation Activities
Quick techniques you can apply during the day.

Exercise One – One Minute of Mindfulness
One quick and fun mindfulness meditation you can do is the One Minute of Mindfulness exercise.

This exercise can also be done throughout the day. Set a timer for 60 seconds and use the minute to focus solely on your breathing. Notice how your breath sounds as you breathe in and out and notice how your body feels. If your mind starts wandering, bring your attention back to your breathing.

This may seem like a simple exercise, but it can be a very powerful one. You can do this exercise with your eyes opened or closed.

Exercise Two – Conscious Observation
This is another quick technique that can help you clear your mind. Pick up an object you have lying around. Any object will do. Hold the object in your hands and allow your attention to be fully absorbed by the object. If you are holding a coffee mug, notice how it feels in your hands. Do not over-analyze it either, allow yourself to be present in the moment.

This type of conscious observation is a powerful form of meditation.

 
[Q] Give some mindfulness meditation exercises:
[A] Mindfulness Meditation Exercises
There are many mindfulness exercises you can practice. A simple breathing exercise is a good place to start.

Two-minute breathing exercise
Begin by getting into a comfortable position. Set a timer for 2 minutes. Close your eyes so you will not be distracted. Relax and see if you notice any areas that seem tight or stiff. If you do, try breathing in and softening those areas.

Check-in with your body and notice how your back feels against the chair or how your feet feel touching the floor. Notice the gentle pull of gravity.

Breathe in through your nose and exhale through your mouth. Notice how the breath effortlessly flows. Notice your belly rising and falling.

Pay attention to how this quick meditation makes you feel as you open your eyes.

Gratitude meditation
Taking a moment to stop and practice gratitude is very powerful. A study done in 2015 showed that mindfulness-based gratitude practices were associated with improvements in happiness, resulting in less stress (O’Leary & Dockray, 2015).

Close your eyes and reflect on something small that you notice at the moment. This might be something like the sight of a tree outside or a feeling of warmth. Next, reflect on someone who has had an impact on your life. This might be someone you know personally or someone you do not know. Express some gratitude for all those things you are grateful for, like a hot cup of coffee in the morning or a good friend.
And do not forget to express some gratitude for your healthy body and for having the presence of mind to be here in this moment.
Take as much time as you need to meditate and reflect.


Transcendental Meditation Exercises
Transcendental Meditation (TM) is a meditation technique that is designed to help you increase your awareness, and it can also help you avoid thoughts that may be distracting.
The technique is from the ancient Vedic traditions of India.

TM uses the idea of repeating a mantra, which is given to the person by the TM instructor. The technique involves closing your eyes and getting into a comfortable position and repeating your word or phrase.

Doing so can help you sharpen your focus and transcend the normal ordinary process of thinking.

Stoic Meditation Exercises
Stoic meditation is based on Stoicism, a philosophy based on restraint, compassion, and humility. The Negative Visualization exercise can help you increase your level of happiness as you focus on how you would feel if you lost certain things from your life (Irvine, 2008). This exercise, while it sounds negative, can help you gain a new level of appreciation for the things you have. Try closing your eyes and imagining how you would feel if you did not have a roof over your head or if you lived in a third world country.

Imagine losing a loved one, an arm, or losing your social status or your job. This exercise is an excellent way to practice gratitude because it allows you to see how blessed you truly are in any given moment.

Try and use all of your senses and see, feel, and hear things. Feel the sun on your skin, and listen for the sound of the waves. Imagine the brilliant blue water and how nice and white the sand is.

As you walk, you might even pick up some small shells or enjoy the feel of the ocean water on your feet. Taste the saltwater on your tongue and enjoy the experience. Stay here as long as you like, and immerse yourself in the experience.

Exercise Number 2 – The Blank Screen
The blank screen helps you empty your mind. Imagine you are staring at a white wall or blank screen. Whenever you notice a random thought, see yourself erasing the thought out of your mind.

When you allow your mind to go blank, you offer no resistance, so your vibration rises naturally. You can then work on any goal you like.

 
[Q] What do you know About Active Recovery Workouts?
[A] Whether you are a serious athlete or an occasional exerciser, you have probably felt the pain of muscle soreness after a hard workout. As long as you are just sore and not injured, you may feel better faster with an active recovery workout, vs. passive recovery (just resting your body).

Active recovery workouts do not need to take up too much of your time. They also do not need to be hard – they should not be – and may include low-intensity exercise, yoga, swimming, or foam rolling.

 
[Q] Why people get sore after exercise?
[A] Muscles grow and get stronger when you work them hard enough to cause tiny tears in the muscle tissue. It is a natural process, but it can still because mild discomfort. 

A different soreness happens when you try a new exercise or a new movement. It usually occurs hours or even a day or two later. Called delayed onset muscle soreness or DOMS, this can involve actual damage to muscles. To avoid this type of pain, experts recommend that when you try an unfamiliar sport or activity, you cut the duration by one-third. DOMS can also happen when you perform a familiar activity but you go extra hard.
 
[Q] Why active recovery workouts help ease muscle soreness?
[A] When you have any type of muscle pain after exercising, you have two options: passive recovery or active recovery. Passive recovery is resting the body. This type of recovery is good for strains and other injuries. For other post-exercise aches and pains, though, experts recommend active recovery, which can be almost any type of light exercise.

Active recovery works because it increases blood flow to the muscles and joints. This improved blood supply takes away toxins and brings in fresh nutrients for healing.

Active recovery workouts should be moderate in intensity. Aim at a heart rate of 30% to 60% of your maximum. Studies show that recovery workouts are less effective when they are hard or vigorous.

 
[Q] Suggest some exercises for active recovery
[A] There are many exercise options for active recovery. It is smart to choose an activity that you like so your recovery will be as helpful to your body as your mind. Some active recovery workouts include:

1) Low-intensity exercise: It is OK to use your regular form of exercise for an active recovery workout. Just remember to dial down the intensity. If you walk or jog, do it at a pace that makes it possible to carry on a conversation. A bike ride is another option. You can even do weight training if you decrease your weight, repetitions, or both. 

2) Yoga: Yoga, and especially slow-paced disciplines like yin yoga, are great for recovery. Yoga can refresh you mentally and psychologically while aiding your physical recovery. 

3) Foam rolling: Some people find relief from sore muscles by using a foam roller, which combines the benefits of exercise and massage. To try this method, place the roller between the floor and the sore area of the body. Slowly roll on it to put light pressure on the muscles. 

Foam rolling can be uncomfortable, and beginners should use it in small doses while avoiding pressure on bones and joints.

4) Swimming and water exercise: Working out in water allows you to benefit from the pressure of the water on the body, which can be compared to the sensation of a light massage. This pressure improves circulation while minimizing stress on the joints. 

In one study of runners, those who used swimming for recovery outperformed a passive recovery group on a run the following day.

 
[Q] When Not to Use Active Recovery?
[A] Active Recovery is not used when  there is pain that exceeds normal soreness. It means that you may need rest or medical care. Besides taxing the muscles, exercise can put stress on bones, tendons, and cartilage. Pain in these areas is likely to be due to an injury. Active recovery strategies could make the injury worse. 

See your doctor if you have any of these symptoms after exercise:

Pain that is constant, sharp, or worsening 
Pain in the area of a previous injury or surgery
A painful area that looks deformed, bruised, or swollen
Pain that does not improve with rest, icing, or anti-inflammatory medications
Pain combined with fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting
Pain that interferes with sleep

 
[Q] What are various ways to ease muscle soreness?
[A] The are may ways to ease sore muscles. Some of them are:

1) Rest: Taking a day off gives your body a chance to repair itself and replenishes your energy. Jennifer Rulon, a seven-time Ironman triathlete and triathlon coach, says the second day after an intense workout can be the toughest. So she suggests doing light exercise the day after a heavy workout, then taking off the next day.

2) Ice: Icing for 20 to 30 minutes can lessen blood flow to sore muscles, which often reduces swelling and pain. And remember: Just because you cannot see muscles swelling does not mean they are not inflamed. Be sure to put a towel between the ice pack and your skin and stick to the time limit (20-30 minutes) to protect your skin. 

3) Heat: If your muscles still ache after 48 hours, try applying some heat (carefully). It can stimulate blood flow to your muscles to ease tightness and help them feel better. Try a warm (not hot) towel or heating pad. But be careful. Take care and watch your body's response. In some cases, heat can further inflame muscles. Follow manufacturer instructions to avoid skin burns, and avoid direct contact with any heating device.

4) Stretching: A gentle stretching routine can help break the cycle of tight sore muscles. Talk to your health care provider or a physical therapist if you are unsure where to start, especially if you have any injuries.

5) Massage: It can relieve muscle tension, boost blood flow, and increase the range of motion in your joints. It is also a great mood lifter. When your muscles are sore, a gentle massage is best. Light pressure may be better for recovery than a deep-tissue massage. Or try tender-point acupressure in which a massage therapist applies pressure and holds it directly on the tender areas.
 
[Q] What is active recovery?
[A] We all know how our bodies feel the day after a challenging workout. It is common for exercisers to experience one or more of the following after a tough workout session: delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS), muscle damage (small microscopic tears that can occur when a muscle is stressed beyond what it is used to), inflammation, and a feeling of physical fatigue. When you are super sore after a workout, it might be tempting to lay down and binge-watch your favorite show to avoid any unnecessary muscle contractions. However, research suggests that doing absolutely nothing might not be the best recovery technique.

 
[Q] Suggest some recovery workouts.
[A] Here are some active recovery workouts:

1) 30-minute cardio-based active recovery workout:

You can merely perform this workout by walking out in nature or using a piece of cardio equipment like a bike, rowing machine, elliptical, or even swimming.

Five minutes: Warm-up, start slow, and find your pace.

Twenty minutes: Maintain a steady pace that gets your heart rate up but still allows you to hold an ongoing conversation. If you start to lose your breath, slow down slightly.

Five minutes: Cool-down, slow down your pace gradually until it is time to stop.

2) Active recovery workout with resistance bands
Because most of the population spends extended time in the seated position, I like to recommend active recovery programs that stretch overactive muscle groups and activate underactive muscle groups. Here is a simple workout that you can try:

3) Foam roll: Calves, hip flexors, and pecs.
Slowly roll over the entire area until you find the tender spot. On a pain scale of 1-10, this tender spot should be at around a 7- painful but tolerable.
Hold still on this spot for 30 seconds up to 2 minutes. If you feel a heartbeat or numbness or tingling, reposition the foam roller until the sensation disappears.

4) Stretch: Calves, hip flexors, and pecs.
Ease into each stretch position until you feel a comfortable stretch. This should not be painful. Hold each stretch for 30 seconds to 1 minute.

5) Circuit: Banded bridge, lateral band walk, external rotation, reverse fly.
Perform 12-15 reps of each exercise in a row for 1-3 sets, depending on how much time you have. Perform each exercise at a 4-2-1 tempo

 
[Q] What are some ways to approach active recovery?
[A] Here are some ways to Approach Active recovery:
1.Between exercise sets. Example: Cycling at a low intensity between lifting sets or a light jog between a set of sprints.
2. Immediately following a tough exercise session (aka the cool-down).
3. Between exercise days. Example: Performing light cardio or doing a low-intensity movement session like yoga.

1) Between exercise sets:
Not only does active recovery help you achieve physiological homeostasis, but research also suggests that active recovery is superior to passive recovery when it comes to how well you can perform during your workout. The High Altitude Exercise Physiology Program research team from Western State Colorado University conducted a study comparing active recovery and passive recovery when it comes to performance during an exercise session.

2) The Cool-Down:
Studies recommend spending about 6-10 minutes after your workout session performing some active recovery for best results . Light cardio exercise, like walking on a treadmill or cycling at a low intensity, can help you get your heart rate down to recover from your workout.

In addition to active recovery, foam rolling is also a great post-workout recovery technique that can reduce DOMS onset. 
Between exercise days:
Typical active recovery activities include walking, swimming, cycling, jogging, yoga, or active stretching. The key is to find an activity that is low-intensity and keeps your heart rate at 30-60% of your maximum heart rate. If you do not track your heart rate or do not know what your maximum is, you can use the talk-test.

If you can hold a steady conversation while doing the activity, it is probably the right intensity to be considered active recovery. I do not recommend trying the talk-test while swimming. There is not necessarily a recommended length of time for these active recovery sessions, so it might be best to follow general exercise guidelines, which recommend at least 30 minutes of physical activity daily.

One side note about using jogging as an active recovery technique: If you are a very well-conditioned, competitive runner, then a jog might be active recovery because, for you, a jog is low-intensity and feels relatively easy.

 
[Q] Make a schedule for active recovery.
[A] Active recovery schedule
When deciding what to do between-sessions, you will want to consider your current training program's intensity level. My favorite way to tackle this is by looking at your training schedule over a week.

Consider how many days a week, you are lifting weights and the strength sessions' length and intensity.

The goal is to balance out your week with a healthy mix of medium to high-intensity training with some low-intensity training for recovery. Rhea et al. (2003) recommends spacing out strength training days with 1-2 rest days in-between. Here are a few examples of what your training schedule might look like:

1) Strength training two days/week:
Sunday		Active Recovery
Monday		Weights
Tuesday		Active Recovery
Wednesday	Active Recovery
Thursday	Weights
Friday		Active Recovery
Saturday	Active Recovery
 

2) Strength training three days/week:
Sunday		Active Recovery
Monday		Weights
Tuesday		Active Recovery
Wednesday	Weights
Thursday	Active Recovery
Friday		Weights
Saturday	Active Recovery
 

3) Strength training four days/week:
Sunday		Active Recovery
Monday		Weights
Tuesday		Weights
Wednesday	Active Recovery
Thursday	Weights
Friday		Active Recovery
Saturday	Weights
 

[Q] How to choose the right active recovery method?
[A] Choosing the right active recovery method
When deciding what to do for active recovery, we have to remember that the goal is to help our bodies get back to homeostasis. This means that the energy systems that fuel our movement will have returned to normal once we reach homeostasis.  Each type of physical activity has some cost associated with it. When we do an intense workout, we make a large withdrawal from that energy bank account and have less to spend afterward. If you make too many consecutive withdrawals from your energy bank, you will start to get charged overdraft fees in the form of overtraining symptoms (i.e., interrupted sleep, elevated resting heart rate, overuse injuries,  and diminishing performance during workouts. Adequate sleep, proper nutrition, and time are all necessary ways to replenish those funds. Without those three components, your energy and performance will undoubtedly suffer.

 
[Q] How to Choose the Right Recovery Activity?
[A] Here are some tips for choosing right recovery activity:
-Choose an activity that you enjoy. Yoga, swimming, cycling, walking, and stretching are all low-intensity activities, but you can think outside the box and make it fun! 

-Monitor your performance to make sure you are not hitting it too hard on active recovery days. How do you feel when you get back to the gym? Do you feel rested and refreshed or not? Adjust accordingly.

-Consider including foam rolling or getting a massage as part of your recovery routine.

 
[Q] What is the Goal of Active Recovery?
[A] The goal of any recovery technique is to help the body return to homeostasis. Simply stated: after you have fully recovered from exercise, you should feel refreshed, no longer sore, and physically ready for the next workout.

Active recovery seeks to accomplish this goal using low-intensity (30-60% maximum heart rate) movement to increase blood flow to simultaneously bring oxygen-rich blood to tissues and remove the cellular waste produced during exercise.

Think of active recovery as a way to promote delivering nutrients to your muscles so that they can recover and heal at a faster rate than if you were sitting on the couch.

 
[Q] Should I Exercise When Sick?
[A] When deciding whether to exercise while sick, many gym-goers follow the “neck rule.” If symptoms are above the neck (such as sinus congestion, sore throat, runny nose, and sneezing), it is safe to work out. Rest if symptoms are below the neck (such as stomach ache, diarrhea, hacking cough, and chest congestion), then take rest and do not do any heavy exercise or workout.

 
[Q] When to Skip the Gym?
[A] Some illnesses are gray areas when it comes to whether or not you are okay to continue exercising, but experts say specific symptoms warrant skipping your workout. It is best to lay low if you experience any of the following:

1. Fever Do not exercise if you have a fever or muscle aches. Fever limits muscle strength, thinking, and the flow of blood to the lungs. Fevers can increase your dehydration risk during exercise.

2. Flu, COVID-19, or Other Contagious Illness: It may be safe to exercise with flu or contagious illness for you but for the sake of others’ health, do not work out in public if you have a contagious illness. From an infection control standpoint, it is best to not exercise in a public space so as to avoid spreading illness. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), flu is contagious anywhere from one day before to seven days after symptom onset.

3. Severe Fatigue Colds and flu can make you tired and weak. When fatigue is severe, exercise can feel like an uphill climb. Listen to that inner voice that tells you you are too tired to work out. Ignoring it could prolong your recovery since exercise taxes your energy stores, potentially exacerbating fatigue.

4. Chest Pain Chest pain is a signal to take it easy, says Balogun, especially if you have any underlying health conditions like cardiovascular or pulmonary issues. These could be potentially exacerbated by working out.

5. Difficulty Breathing Shortness of breath means you are not ready for the gym. Anyone with difficulty breathing through the mouth should skip their workout. If you are getting short of breath or having difficulty breathing through the mouth, it could mean that there is an issue with the lungs. Consult your doctor if you have swelling in your ankles, trouble breathing when you lie flat, high fever, or wheezing along with shortness of breath.

 
[Q] Suggest some tips for exercising when sick?
[A] Here are some tips for Exercising When Sick:

1. Lower the intensity: Do not expect to pick up your workouts where you left off. In addition to symptoms such as runny nose and sore throat, you may feel deconditioned if you spent several days limiting physical activity. Plus, your body is still fighting whatever made you sick, so it cannot fully support your needs during and after exercise. To help your body recover, reduce your exercise intensity by 50 percent. Keep your intensity down with an activity like yoga or Pilates. You can also try walking instead of running, or using lighter weights than you are used to.

2. Increase intensity slowly: If you tolerate low-intensity workouts well, gradually increase the intensity. A graded and gradual approach to exercise is safer to minimize the risk of injury or symptom aggravation.

3. Stay hydrated: Exercise and illness can make you dehydrated, especially when you combine the two. Mild to severe dehydration can cause symptoms such as confusion, dizziness, headache, fatigue, muscle cramps, fainting, and rapid heartbeat. Prioritize hydration before, during, and after your workout. Also, avoid exercises and intensities that make you sweaty, as sweating a lot can make you dehydrated.

4. Listen to your body: Before working out, check in with how you are feeling. If your symptoms are too much, it is okay to skip your workout. If you decide to exercise, pay attention to how you feel during the workout. Modify or stop the workout if your energy drops or your symptoms worsen.

 
[Q] Suggest some exercises for Weight Loss
[A] Losing weight happens by not only changing your eating habits, but also stepping up your exercise routine. Regular exercise will go a long way in achieving your goals. To lose weight, you should aim to get at least 300 minutes of moderately intense activity each week. Here are some exercises that can help you on that journey. Just remember to first talk with your doctor about which ones might be best for you.
In my opinion, here are some best exercises for Weight Loss:

1. Walking
If you were to add half an hour of brisk walking to your daily routine, you could burn about 150 more calories than you usually do each day. The faster and longer you walk, the more calories you burn. Walking is a great option if you are new to regular exercise. Start with shorter journeys and build up to longer, more intense ones.

2. Use Jumping Rope
If you are looking for a cheap piece of workout equipment you will be able to take on trips, a jump-rope just might be for you. Jumping rope is a fantastic way to burn calories fast. In fact, you will burn more of them by jumping rope than walking on a treadmill for the same amount of time. You will also work multiple muscle groups, from your core to your upper and lower body. Jumping rope can also improve your coordination.

3. High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)
High-intensity interval training (also called HIIT) is a type of workout that switches back and forth from intense physical activity to less-intense exercise. You should not do it every day, but it is very effective for weight loss. You will burn more calories with HIIT than with steady cardio. The intense exercise keeps your body working and in fat-burning mode for up to 24 hours after your workout ends.

4. Cycling
Cycling is another great way to lose weight, and it is a low-impact, adaptable exercise. You can burn about 400-750 calories an hour riding a bike, depending on your weight, how fast you are going, and what type of cycling you are doing.

5. Swimming
It can be hard to be motivated to work out if your knees are achy or your back hurts. If you are in that boat, swimming is an ideal exercise. It is easy on your joints, you will use both your upper and lower body, and you will get a good cardio workout. You will reap the benefits from the resistance of the water, too. If you swim for a half-hour a few times a week, you will lower your risk of heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers. It will also bring down your bad cholesterol and blood pressure.

6. Strength Training
This type of exercise uses resistance to build strength and muscle. It not only helps you lose weight, but also helps you keep the weight off by building muscle. That will help your body burn more fat. Try to do some strength training 3-5 times a week, for about an hour each time. Do not forget to rest a day between every 2 days that you do it.

7. Jogging
Jogging is an aerobic exercise -- it uses oxygen. This can help you lose weight. A good jog can also raise something called your metabolic rate for up to 24 hours. So, you will be in fat-burning mode even after you have crossed your daily finish line. Done regularly, jogging can help boost your metabolism for a long period of time.


[Q] What are Pilates?
[A] Research says that Pilates -- exercises usually done on a mat or with various tools that emphasize core strength -- can make you stronger and help you keep a healthy weight. The intensity of a Pilates class depends on your needs. You can find some classes or demonstrations online or at your local gym.


[Q] How to perform burpees?
[A] Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. In one fluid motion, lower your body into a squat, place your hands on the ground in front of your feet, and jump your feet back so you land in a plank position. Then jump to return your feet to near your hands and complete a powerful jump straight up into the air. Repeat. To make it more challenging, add a push-up when you are in the plank position. If you are a beginner, do a squat thrust instead for lower impact: The move is similar to a burpee, except you do not complete the explosive jump at the end and simply stand up. 

[Q] How to perform Squat Jumps?
[A] Squat Jumps
With your feet shoulder-width apart, lower your body into a squat position (back and upper body stay lifted, and hips and butt lower down to the ground as if you are sitting in an imaginary chair). Keep your core tight and launch into an explosive jump. Land lightly on your feet and immediately lower into a squat again. Repeat. To make this move more challenging, you can wear a weight vest or hold a weighted ball or light dumbbells.


[Q] How to perform Skater Jumps?
[A] Skater Jumps
Stand with your feet hip-width apart. With your right foot planted, cross your left leg behind you and out to your right side (almost as if you are doing a curtsy lunge). Your weight should be supported by your right leg. Simultaneously, swing your right arm out to about shoulder height and your left arm across your body reaching toward your right hip. Then jump to your left and repeat the movement on your left side. Land on your left foot and swing your right leg behind you and out to your left side. (Left arm should simultaneously swing out to your left side and right arm should extend toward your left hip.) Continue leaping back and forth with arms swinging in a skating motion. To make this move more challenging, try touching your hand to the ground instead of simply swinging it out to the side.

[Q] How to perform Plank Jacks?
[A] Plank Jacks
Begin in a plank position with your wrists in line with your shoulders and your body extended in a straight line behind you. Your feet should be planted together on the floor. Jump your legs out wide, and then jump them back together at a quick pace. Be sure to keep your core engaged throughout and be careful not to let your hips sag.
 
[Q] What is the best way to lose weight quickly?
[A] While rapid weight loss is tempting, it is best to focus on sustainable approaches like eating a calorie-controlled diet with balanced macronutrients, staying physically active, and making long-term lifestyle changes.

 
[Q] Should I focus on cardio or strength training for weight loss?
[A] A combination of both works best. Cardio burns calories, while strength training helps build muscle mass, which boosts metabolism even when you are not working out.

 
[Q] How can I stay motivated during my weight loss journey?
[A] Set realistic goals, track your progress, celebrate small achievements, and remind yourself of the benefits. Surrounding yourself with a support system also helps keep you on track.

 
[Q] Can I lose weight without exercising?
[A] While exercise accelerates weight loss and improves overall health, creating a calorie deficit by managing your food intake is key. Pair it with light activities such as walking to aid the process.

 
[Q] What foods should I avoid to lose weight? 
[A] To lose weight, avoid processed foods, sugary drinks, and refined carbs like white bread and pastries. Focus on whole foods, lean proteins, and healthy fats.

 
[Q] How many calories should I eat to lose weight?
[A] The number of calories you need depends on your age, gender, activity level, and weight goals. A common approach is to reduce your daily intake by 500-1000 calories to lose about 1-2 pounds per week.

 
[Q] How long does it take to start seeing results? 
[A] You may begin to notice weight loss results within 2-4 weeks of consistent diet and exercise. However, individual results vary, and it is important to focus on long-term progress.

 
[Q] Is intermittent fasting effective for weight loss? 
[A] Yes, intermittent fasting can help with weight loss by limiting the time available for eating, leading to a reduction in calorie intake. However, the quality of your meals still matters.

 
[Q] Can drinking water help me lose weight? 
[A] Drinking water can aid weight loss by promoting fullness, boosting metabolism, and helping with digestion. Aim to drink water before meals to help control appetite.

 
[Q] How important is sleep for weight loss? 
[A] Sleep is crucial for weight loss because it regulates hunger hormones and improves energy levels. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night to support your weight loss efforts.

 
[Q] Can stress affect my weight loss progress?
[A] Yes, stress can negatively impact weight loss by raising cortisol levels, which can increase cravings and lead to overeating. Managing stress with activities like meditation or exercise can help.

 
[Q] Are cheat meals okay when trying to lose weight?
[A] Occasional cheat meals can help satisfy cravings and keep you motivated, but it is important to get back to your regular healthy eating plan afterward to avoid hindering your progress.

 
[Q] How can I prevent muscle loss while losing weight?
[A] To prevent muscle loss during weight loss, focus on strength training exercises and ensure you are eating enough protein. This helps maintain muscle mass while you she would fat.

 
[Q] Is it okay to eat carbs while trying to lose weight?
[A] Yes, you can eat carbs while losing weight, but focus on complex carbs like whole grains, vegetables, and legumes. These provide sustained energy and help you feel full longer.

 
[Q] How can I lose 20 pounds in a month?
[A] While it may be possible to she would twenty lbs in a month, this is not recommended. A safer and more manageable approach to weight loss is to focus on gradually losing weight through a combination of a balanced diet and exercise. This will help you remain healthy while keeping the weight off in the long run.
